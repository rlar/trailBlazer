trailBlazer

a JS/Canvas game based around solving 2D path-based puzzles.
inspired by a minigame from an old Zelda game for GameBoy.

current features:
10x10 maps of red, blue, wall, empty tiles
WASD/direction arrow movement
XML level descriptions

future ideas:
- gameplay:
  - compare users score to minimum score in end-of-level notice
  - record of level, attempts, best score
  - yellow tiles which flip to blue before red for cooler puzzles
  - bombs or something that will flip surrounding tiles in a + or something
  - PORTAL TILES
  - _PLACEABLE PORTAL TILES_
  - restart game when beaten?
  
- interface:
  - retry/next level menus
  - replace the shitty alert()'s with an on canvas menu or something
  - put the <p> blurb below the canvas into an on-canvas menu? or something?
  - resizeable canvas for irregularly shapes maps?
  

- mapstuffs:
  - resizeable canvas for irregularly shapes maps?
  - some kind of validation for map XML's
  - RESTful service to GET maps, eventually POST too (for: )
  - a way to create maps either in game, or import from .csv, etc (gdocs api?)
